The app is for caretakers to be able to manage what medication the patients take. The app has the following features:

* The caretakers can create accounts for themselves as well as the patients.
  * Patients cannot create accounts of their own.
* The caretaker will then be able to set medications that the patient needs to take as well as when the mediaction has to be taken. 
* The app alerts the patient when to take the necessary medication. 
* If the patient fails to log in that they have taken the medication or if they have not taken the medication both the caretaker and the user are alerted.
